A dynamic visualization tool for popular pathfinding algorithms implemented in Python with curses. Watch in real-time as algorithms like BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, and A* navigate through mazes to find optimal paths.
Features

Interactive maze generation and customization
Visualization of search process with color-coded paths
Multiple algorithm implementations for comparison
Adjustable animation speed
Easy-to-understand code structure for educational purposes

This project demonstrates how different pathfinding techniques work under various conditions and constraints, providing both a visual learning tool and a foundation for understanding graph traversal algorithms.
